            Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
            rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
            cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and
            there’s no such thing as an issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing
            exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our
            senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense,
            our reality changes. That’s possible because our perception is
            limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
            translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way,
            our reality changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can
            change reality that much, everything’s fake.
          </p>
          <p>
            They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see
            that person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine
            falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself
            differently. But the person is the same, you just changed your mind.
            Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your
            world, it’s that you passively do it anyway.

            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They
            said,
            <mark class="villager"
              >“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
              unfortunate.”</mark
            >
            The farmer said,
            <mark class="farmer"
              >“Is it <mark class="good">good</mark>? Is it
              <mark class="bad">bad</mark>? I don't know.” </mark
            >The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with
            it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
            <mark class="villager"
              >“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have
              eight horses!”</mark
            >
            The farmer again said,<mark class="farmer">
              “Is it <mark class="good">good</mark>? Is it
              <mark class="bad">bad</mark>? I don't know.”</mark
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and
            while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then
            said,
            <mark class="villager"
              >“Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,”</mark
            >
            and the farmer responded,<mark class="farmer">
              “Is it <mark class="good">good</mark>? Is it
              <mark class="bad">bad</mark>? I don't know.”</mark
            >
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
            people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a
            broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<mark
              class="villager"
            >
              “Isn’t that great!”</mark
            >
            Again, he said,
            <mark class="farmer"
              >“Is it <mark class="good">good</mark>? Is it
              <mark class="bad">bad</mark>? I don't know.”</mark
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
            complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
            happens in it is <mark class="good">good</mark> or
            <mark class="bad">bad</mark> — because you never know what will be
            the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be
            the consequences of <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.
